    <p>In today’s evolving work environment, Gen-Z is becoming a dominant part of the global workforce. Businesses are increasingly facing difficulty in attracting, engaging, and retaining Gen-Z employees. This poses a significant business challenge because:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Talent Retention Impacts Performance and Profitability:</strong> High turnover rates among Gen-Z employees lead to increased recruitment and training costs. Losing young, innovative talent also affects continuity and knowledge retention within teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Employer Branding and Talent Acquisition:</strong> Companies that fail to meet Gen-Z’s expectations face reputational risks on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or X (formerly Twitter), reducing the quality of applicants they attract.</li>
      <li><strong>Mismatch Between Job Roles and Aspirations:</strong> Many Gen-Zs pursue careers that reflect personal values and creativity, but employers often emphasize stability and hierarchy.</li>
      <li><strong>Changing Nature of Work:</strong> Gen-Z expects tech-driven collaboration and flexible models. Employers who haven’t adapted are perceived as outdated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📌 Objective</h3>

    <p>
      This project explores the misalignment between Gen Z professionals and traditional employers through case observations, data-backed reasoning, and personal experiences. It aims to help organizations improve Gen Z recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies.
